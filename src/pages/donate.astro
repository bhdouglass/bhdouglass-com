    <p>
      I'm <a href="/">Brian Douglass</a>, a software engineer by day and open source developer by night.
      My development has varied between web, desktop, and more, but my current focus
      is on building awesome things with <a href="https://ubuntu-touch.io/" class="underline">Ubuntu Touch</a>.
      I'm the lead developer for the <a href="https://open-store.io/" class="underline">OpenStore</a>,
      an open source app store for Ubuntu Touch. I'm also the lead developer for
      <a href="http://clickable-ut.dev/en/latest/" class="underline">Clickable</a> an open source tool
      for building and maintaining Ubuntu Touch applications. I've also build several
      <a href="https://open-store.io/?sort=relevance&search=author%3ABrian%20Douglass" class="underline">apps for Ubuntu Touch</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm not looking to make tons on money doing this, but I do want to be able
      to work on open source and Ubuntu Touch more than I do now.
      So if you do donate or if you don't I still appreciate your support!
    </p>
