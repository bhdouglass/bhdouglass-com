For this recipe I tried several different tea varieties in different quantities.
I settled on 6 bags of Earl Grey tea and 6 bags of English Breakfast. Different
brands of tea can have different taste, so I encourage you to try a few different
kinds to get the right blend for your own palate. And when you are experimenting
you can adjust the sugar content to your liking. I prefer a much sweeter sweet tea,
so the recipe might call for more sugar that you desire.
