I have been interested in starting a garden for several years now. And with
everything going on in the world I decided that 2022 was the year to finally get
started. To get prepared, I did a ton of research. In my research, I found that
starting seeds indoors can help get a jump on the growing season. This is especially
important in growing zones with shorter seasons like mine. Here is a quick list
of things I bought to get going with indoor seed starting.

## 1. Containers

I opted to skip soil block for now and just went with containers. I choose some
six-cell trays with holes in the bottoms for bottom watering. These sit on
top of standard size propagation trays

## 2. Seed Starting Mix

I was not aware at first, but there is a difference between seed starting mix
and potting mix. I ended up buying both, but I should be able to use the potting mix
if I need to "pot up" any seedlings.

## 3. Grow Light

Since I'm growing plants in my basement I needed to get a grow light.
This also allows me to provide more light to my seedlings than the current outside
conditions.

## 4. Heating Mat & Thermometer

Many seeds will germinate faster with the right soil temperature. The seeds that
I purchased had the germination time for different soil temperatures printed on the
packet. In addition to a heat map, I purchased a thermometer to regulate the
heat mat to a specific temperature.

## 5. Fan

An oscillating fan can help simulate outside conditions. It is my understanding
that this can help when it comes time to transplant as the plants will become
hardier with the fake wind.

## 6. Timer/Smart Plug

I wanted to make this seed starting experience as smooth as possible. So I set up
my grow light with a smart plug. My home automation system then powers the plug
on a set schedule.
