This is probably one of the best kitchen hacks I've learned all year. It is super
simple to regrow green onions from scraps. And when you do you can have a continuous
supply of green onions for all your cooking needs. Simply follow these steps:

1. Cut off the root ends while leaving the roots attached.
2. Place the roots in a small jar with the cut ends up.
3. Fill the jar with water, but don't submerge the whole root end.
4. Keep on a windowsill, changing the water every few days.
5. After the onions grow to about 5 inches, plant them in the ground or into a pot.
6. Cut the green onions down to the ground level whenever you need them!
