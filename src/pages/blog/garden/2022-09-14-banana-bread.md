I've tried several different banana bread recipes and finally settled on this one
as my favorite. The technique for sprinkling sugar on the greased pan was passed
down from my mother and gives it a extra special touch. As a side note, I have
made this with 2 or 3 bananas and have had good results either way. Just make sure
to check your bread frequently has the different amounts will need different cooking
times. Enjoy this recipe for breakfast by warming it in the microwave for 10 seconds
with butter!
