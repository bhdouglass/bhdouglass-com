I have just released Falcon version 1.2. It includes a brand new "favorites"
section. In order to add apps or scopes to your favorites just long press the
app/scope then choose to favorite it. To unfavorite do the same thing (except
hit the unfavorite button!).

Falcon can be found in the
[OpenStore](https://open-store.io/app/falcon.bhdouglass),
with the full source available under the GPL v3
on [GitHub](https://github.com/bhdouglass/falcon)
