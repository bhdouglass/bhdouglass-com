The OpenStore app has seen another good release this past week with version 2.94.
While the current version of the app is 2.95, it's only a minor release with some
visual tweaks, the good stuff happened in v2.94. This release improves upon the
new warning dialog for unconfined apps, while also removing the scary messaging
from core apps that might need extra permissions. Additionally handling for
non-OpenStore apps and offline uninstalls has now been implemented. Previously
the OpenStore app would seem unresponsive if you tried to access an app that didn't
exist yet in the OpenStore or while offline. Now you will see a stripped down version
of the app page that allows you to see the currently installed version and optionally
uninstall that app. This closes a long standing bug where the new versions of
Unity 8 (now Lomiri) didn't have the ability to uninstall apps (as it was relying
on the OpenStore to do it).

If you run into any issues with the latest update, feel free to
