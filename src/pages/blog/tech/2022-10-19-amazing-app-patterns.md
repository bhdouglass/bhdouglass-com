The blog, [web.dev](https://web.dev/) looks like a great resource for developers.
In one of their recent posts,
[New patterns for amazing apps](https://web.dev/new-patterns-for-amazing-apps/),
Thomas Steiner details some of the resources present on web.dev. There a lots of
code snippets for how to do various app patterns, like handling clipboards.
Each pattern comes with a bunch of these fully functional snippets. This is definitely
a site that I will be saving for future reference. I even added the blog to my
list of RSS feeds.
