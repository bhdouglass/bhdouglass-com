- installed kubuntu
  - needed to install driver for the touch pad to work
    - installed system76 driver for it to work at all
    - installed xserver-xorg-input-synaptics for it to work with tap to touch
    - made install process interesting (partitioning was very challenging)
      - installer could use a little work with a keyboard only
      - hard to know which thing was selected during partitioning
      - Sometimes the order of "tabbing" was unexpected
