Clickable 6.0.0 has been released! What started as a few small fixes snowballed
into many changes from several developers. The Clickable team decided that it
made sense to bump the next major version to 6 and introduce some breaking changes.
Some of the features that I want to highlight here is the new `--dark-mode` flag
when using desktop mode. This allows you to test out your apps on your desktop
using Ubuntu Touch's the dark styles. Also in desktop mode is another new argument,
`--gdbserver`. This allows for debugging your application using your standard tools.
Some noteworthy breaking changes are the removal of the deprecated `dependencies`,
lxd support, and vivid support. Additionally the `click-build` command has been
deprecated and it's functionality moved into the `build` command. There are many
more new features, fixes, and changes, so check out the full
[changelog](http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/changelog.html).

Behind the scenes there was a major refactor of the desktop command. The desktop
command was becoming an unwieldy command source wise. It has now been broken down
into smaller, more manageable parts. For the templates they have also been updated
to respect the user's selected license and also display the GPL notice in source
files.
