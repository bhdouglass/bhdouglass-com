Clickable 6.5.0 has been released and it brings some neat new features.
Clickable now has support for bash completion. It is not automatically installed,
but this will change as the team figures out the best way forward. If you want
to know how to use the bash completion today, check out
[the guide on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/clickable/clickable/blob/master/BASH_COMPLETION.md).
The next feature is arm64 support for qmake projects. Back in version 6.1.0
Clickable gained support for compiling apps to the arm64 architecture, but not
for qmake apps. Now all types of apps can be compiled to arm64 which will allow
developers to get ready for the PinePhone and more to get into the hands of people everywhere.
The last new feature in 6.5.0 is the new `install_data` configuration. With it
you can run arbitrary commands as part of Clickable's process to create a Docker
container for your app. For more information, head over to the
[Clickable docs](http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/clickable-json.html#image-setup).

If you run into any issues with Clickable please report them in the
[GitLab Issues](https://gitlab.com/clickable/clickable/issues).
