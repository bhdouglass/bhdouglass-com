Version 4.2.2 of Clickable has just been released. With it comes better support
for Cordova templates. The work for this latest update comes thanks to Marco S!
He was able to integrate the Cordova workflow into the Clickable docker container
so there is no need to have Cordova installed on your computer and there is no need
to mess with the old chroots. This greatly simplifies the usage of Cordova apps
and will hopefully allow Cordova apps to be easily ported to Ubuntu Touch.

In addition to the Cordova support, two new commands have been added to
Clickable. The first is `clickable update-docker` which will update your docker
container to the latest version without needing to remember docker commands.
The second command is `clickable review`. It will run click-review on your built
click package and give you back the results. The click-review command is run in
the docker container so you don't need to have it install on your own computer.
In order to use `clickable review` you'll want to first run `clickable update-docker`
to make sure you have the latest container with click-review support.

If you have any issues with Clickable feel free to reach out on the
[Clickable GitHub repo](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable/issues).
