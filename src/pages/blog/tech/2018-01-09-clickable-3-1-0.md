Clickable development has been in full swing lately! I've recently published
v3.0.0 and v3.1.0. You can find the [latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable/releases)
until the Launchpad build servers come back online.
v3.0.0 comes with an awesome new feature: app templates. All you need to do to
take advantage of this new feature is to run `clickable init`. This will present
you with several options for generating a new app from a template. Now you don't
need to manually copy a template or write everything from scratch. You can
quickly bootstrap a new app using one of the prebuilt templates provided by
clickable. The currently available app templates are:

- [Pure QML App (built using CMake)](https://github.com/bhdouglass/ut-app-pure-qml-cmake-template)
- [C++/QML App (built using CMake)](https://github.com/bhdouglass/ut-app-cmake-template)
- [Python/QML App (built using CMake)](https://github.com/bhdouglass/ut-app-python-cmake-template)
- [HTML App](https://github.com/bhdouglass/ut-app-html-template)
- [Simple Webapp](https://github.com/bhdouglass/ut-app-webapp-template)

v3.1.0 brings some fixes for running clickable inside a container (for use with
things like continuous integration). It also adds an awesome feature of being
able to test your apps on your desktop. Just run `clickable --desktop`
to have clickable compile and run the app on your computer. It achieves this
by forwarding the X display into a docker container and runs the apps from there.
I hope this will allow a better user experience when creating click apps,
especially for developers that don't yet have an Ubuntu Touch devices.

Any comments, suggestions, pull requests, or bug reports on these templates,
desktop mode,  or [clickable itself](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable/issues)
are appreciated!
