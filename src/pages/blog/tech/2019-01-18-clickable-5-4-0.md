Thanks to a lot of work by [Tim Süberkrüb](https://gitlab.com/timsueberkrueb)
Clickable now has support for compiling Rust apps for Ubuntu Touch! Version 5.4.0
is now available for download with a new docker image that contains all the
necessary bits to get you started with Rust apps. You'll need to run
`clickable update` to get the latest docker image. Tim has even created a Rust
app template that you can use to get started, just run `clickable create` and
choose the brand new Rust option. And if you want more info about using Rust and
QML for making Ubuntu Touch apps check out
[Tim's blog post on the subject](https://timsueberkrueb.io/posts/2019/01/18/rust-ubuntu-touch-apps-app-dev/).
I just want to say a huge thank you to Tim for his work on getting Rust support
in Clickable!

In addition to Tim's work on Rust support I've also added a fix for distros using
SELinux. The change was discovered by a user running Fedora. Clickable v5.4.0
now passes and extra parameter to docker commands to allow it to work properly
on systems using SELinux.

If you run into any issues with Clickable please report them in the
[GitLab Issues](https://gitlab.com/clickable/clickable/issues).
