Falcon v2.00 has just landed in the [OpenStore](https://open.uappexplorer.com/app/falcon.bhdouglass)!
With this new version it brings a bunch of new settings for customization.
You can now choose different sizes of the app icons: small, medium, and large.
Although on a phone these sizes don't make much sense, but can be useful for
table users. You can now choose between different layouts for your apps: grid,
carousel, vertical and horizontal. Another new option is the option to hide
scopes. If you don't use many scopes regularly this can really cut down on the
noise in Falcon.

In addition to all the new settings, Falcon now supports desktop app launching
via Libertine. Several desktop apps are preinstalled on the M10 tablet and
will automatically show up in your list of apps (or separately depending on
your settings). Falcon even supports custom containers managed through libertine.
