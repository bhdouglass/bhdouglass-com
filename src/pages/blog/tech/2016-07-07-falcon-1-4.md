The lastest version of the Falcon app launch is now available in the
[OpenStore](https://open.uappexplorer.com/app/falcon.bhdouglass)! This version
includes a new feature that allows users to apply icon packs to the scope.
You can now customize your home screen even further. A big thank you to
Stuart Langridge (sil) for suggesting this new feature. I've included two example
icon packs to get the ball rolling. Anyone interested in submitting an icon
pack should [contact me on my website](http://bhdouglass.com/contact.html).
