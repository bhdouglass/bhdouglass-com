Earlier today version 2.60 of the OpenStore app was release. This release would
not have been possible if not for many awesome contributors. Many thanks to the
work done by Joan, Christian, Rodney, Dalton, and many translators! The highlight of
v2.60 is the new "Update All" button in the app list. A feature that has long
been requested, the Update All button does exactly as it says on the label,
updates all the apps with updates. The update all button smartly ignores any app
with a version that doesn't come from the OpenStore (for example, beta testing a
new version) and the OpenStore app lists them separately. Another new feature is
the loading indicator for the banner image. It will show up to let you know that
the app is fetching data in the background. And lastly, there are new URIs for
opening the "My Apps" tab: `openstore://my-apps` and `openstore://updates`. This
could be useful for app developers to let users launch the OpenStore to get the
latest version of their app.

In addition to v2.60 of the OpenStore app, there were also some bug fixes and
clean up in the api and website. If you notice any issues in any part of the
OpenStore, feel free to [send a bug report](https://gitlab.com/theopenstore/openstore-meta/issues)!
