After the last two heafty releases of Clickable comes a smaller Clickable version
6.2.0. In this version we've cleared up the confusing `--debug-build` by replacing
it with `--debug`. `--debug` was previously being used to show debug information
for Clickable itself (and itself confusing as well), so that has now changed to
`--verbose`. A new argument, `--skip-build`, has been added for desktop mode. This
allows you to re-run an app in desktop mode without recompiling it. Lastly, we've
added initial support to build apps on MacOS. This is due to my main Linux laptop
being shipped off for a repair, leaving me with a work issued Mac to develop on.
As Macs seem to be a popular choice among developers, hopefully this can help
bring more developers to Ubuntu Touch.

If you run into any issues with Clickable please report them in the
[GitLab Issues](https://gitlab.com/clickable/clickable/issues).
