In [my recent post](/blog/selfhosting-with-docker-compose-leaving-yunohost/),
I talked about leaving YunoHost and switching to Docker Compose. A large driver
of the switch was to be able to move some of my important services offsite to a
hosted VPS. I was able to set up my new self-hosting setup with one giant Docker Compose
file locally. Once I had every service working the way I like, I split the Docker Compose
file into two. One for the local server and one for the cloud server. Because all the
data is separate from the system I was able to simply move the data for the cloud
services to a new location and be up and running in no time at all. I was also able
to move some services back locally with the same ease. Simply shut down the Docker
container on one server and start it up again on the other server.

For a Docker Compose setup, the configuration is all contained in one spot. With
Yunohost I had to track down various bits of data and configurations for each app.
Combining this with a system automation framework like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
and you have a completely reproducible build.

I did run into a few snags while migrating. Most of these issues probably don't
apply to most situations. The biggest problem that I faced was changing the authentication
methods. Since Yunohost had most apps integrated into their LDAP server, I had to
do some manual database intervention to get some apps working again. Nextcloud handles
LDAP users separately from regular users. To overcome this I had to recreate the
users in the database with the same names to transfer the data. Here is a
[forum post](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/import-ldap-users-get-rid-of-ldap/56629/11)
over at the Nextcloud forum detailing the migration steps that I followed.

One piece of advice I would give to anyone that is starting on a self-hosting journey,
stick to one type of database as much as possible. My first setup had both PostgreSQL
and MySQL databases. Unfortunately, the 1GB VPS that I was running couldn't handle
both databases and the apps that I wanted to run. I imagine this would be similar
for memory-constrained systems like some models of Raspberry Pis. Luckily many apps
support several different database types. So limiting myself to one database was
just a matter of migrating the data. I ended up using a manual migration, but
I encountered [pgloader](https://pgloader.io/) as a tool to migrate from different
databases to PostgreSQL.
