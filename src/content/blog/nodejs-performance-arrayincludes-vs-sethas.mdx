When you want to find out if an array contains a value, what tools do you reach for?
There is `Array.includes()` and `Set.has()`. So which one is better? Let's dive in
and find out!

## The Different Ways to Combine Arrays

### `Array.include()`

```javascript
const included = arr.include(value);
```

This is pretty straightforward, you have an array of values. You want to know
if a specific value is contained in that array. Couldn't be more simple.

### `Set.has()`

```javascript
const included = set.has(value);
```

Similar to `Array.includes()`, `Set.has()` lets you test if a set contains a certain
value.

### Creating a set from an array

```javascript
const set = new Set(arr);
const included = set.has(value);
```

So, what if you already have an array, but have heard great things about the performance
of `Set.has()`? You'll have to create a new set from the array using `new Set(arr)`.

## Note About Arrays vs Sets

It is important to note how arrays and sets differ. Technical details aside, the
biggest difference between an array and a set is that sets only allow unique data
in them. By contrast, an array allows duplicate values. It depends on your
use case when developing which one you want to use.

## Testing Methodology

As with my previous [benchmarking of loops](/blog/nodejs-performance-loops) and [array combining](/blog/nodejs-performance-arrayconcat-vs-the-spread-operator),
I used the [Tinybench](https://github.com/tinylibs/tinybench) library. The benchmarks
use sets and arrays in different variations to check if they contain a value. The
value used in the test isn't in the arrays so we can test the worst-case scenario,
when the whole array needs to be scanned to find the value. This test was run against
different array lengths to see if one method or another was more effective at different
sizes.

The tests also use different run times to compare performance across engines.
Currently, the engines included are:

- Node.js v18
- Node.js v20
- Node.js v22
- Bun v1.3.18
- Deno v2.1.4

You can see the full test suite over at my [GitHub Repo](https://gitlab.com/bhdouglass/javascript-performance/-/blob/master/includes/includes-tests.js).

Browsers weren't considered for this test as I'm mainly focusing on server-side
JavaScript engines.

## The Test Machine

The machine I'm running these tests on is a
[System76 Darter Pro 8](/blog/system76-darter-pro-8). It has a 12th-generation
Intel CPU that clocks in around 4.70 GHz (model i7-1260P). And it has 32 GB of RAM.

## Results

Here are the results combining two arrays with lengths of ten, one thousand, ten thousand, and one hundred thousand.

## Conclusions

`Set.has()` has way better performance than `Array.includes()`. However, that's not
the whole story. The `Set.has()` test doesn't include creating a set from an array.
That benchmark reflects the case when you already have a set created.

But if you create a set from an array you need to consider the performance impact
of creating the set from the array values. But once you have the set created, well
then you can have crazy fast lookup times if you need to query the set multiple times.

If you need to look up values in an array multiple times, you take a performance
hit each time you need to scan the array. So you may be tempted to convert it to
a set and use `Set.has()`. However, that's not always your best option unless you
are doing a lot of `Set.has()` calls.

An interesting outcome from this benchmark shows that Node v22 may not have as good
performance with `Array.includes()` as v18 and v20 have. This is at larger array
lengths as smaller arrays v22 seems to have a better time with than v18 and v20.

Another interesting observation is that Node v20 seems to perform extremely well
with `Array.includes()` at large array compared to everything else. This could just
be a fluke or a flaw in my testing.

## So, what is the best way to see if an array has a value in JavaScript?

The answer is... it depends! As with everything in programming, the best tool for the
job depends a lot on context. If you have an array and don't need to do many calls
to `Array.includes()` you can just use `Array.includes()`. If you already have a set
just use `Set.has()`.

However, if you have an array and want to convert it to a set to use `Set.has()`
you probably shouldn't. Unless that array is very large and you need to do a large
number of lookups on the array, it is probably not worth the cost to initialize
the set.

However, (again) if you know you need to do lookups on an array and you can create
a set instead of creating an array, then you might want to consider doing that to
reap the faster lookup times of `Set.has()`.
