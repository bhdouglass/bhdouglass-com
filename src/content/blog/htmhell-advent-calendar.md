description: Snuggle up with some hot cocoa and the HTMHell Advent Calendar
---

'Tis the season to code and create! It's that time of year again my fellow developers.
And by that time of year I mean time for the [HTMHell Advent Calendar](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/)!

This isn't your typical holiday calendarâ€”no chocolate behind these doors (well,
unless you code chocolate into your app). Instead, it is a selection of articles
about, you guessed it, HTML. Each article is well thought out and informative.
And they shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to read.

And if 24 articles weren't enough for you, be sure to check out the previous
years' advent calendars:

- [HTMHell Advent Calendar for 2022](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2022/)
- [HTMHell Advent Calendar for 2021](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2021/)

And if you are looking for something more hands-on, check out the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Happy coding, and may your code be merry and bright!
