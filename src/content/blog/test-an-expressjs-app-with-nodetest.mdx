[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is still a solid web framework option for Node.js,
even in 2025. Especially since [v5 was released in late 2024](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html).
If you are looking to get some test coverage on your Express app, look no further
than the built-in [Node.js Test Runner](/blog/nodejs-test-runner/).

## Initial Setup

Start a new project if you want to follow along with this blog post. Set it up
with [`npm init`](/blog/npm-basics/) and be sure to set `"type": "module"`
in the generated `package.json` so we can use ESM imports.

### Installing Dependencies

In this example, we'll be using Express version 5 and testing it using supertest.
Run `npm install express@^5 supertest` to install them both.

## Basic Express Setup

Here is a pretty basic Express app. The GET route returns some text and the POST
route has some basic error handling for a pretend database call. It is split
into two different files, `index.js` and `app.js`. Splitting the initialization
of the Express app into `app.js` will make it easier for us to write tests for it.

```javascript
// --- index.js ---
import { setupApi } from "./app.js";

const app = setupApi();

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('ðŸš€ http://localhost:3000');
});

// --- app.js ---
import express from 'express';

export const database = {
  saveData() {
    // Pretend this is a database call
  },
};

export function setupApi() {
  const app = express();

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Get Received');
  })

  app.post('/', (req, res) => {
    try {
      database.saveData();
    }
    catch (e) {
      res.status(500);
      res.send('Received an error');
      return;
    }

    res.send('Post Received');
  });

  return app;
}
```

To run this app, simply point Node at it: `node index.js`.

## Writing Tests

Writing tests with `node:test` is very simple, especially if you are familiar with
other testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha. Here is what our test file looks like:

```javascript
// --- app.test.js ---
import { test, describe, before } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import request from 'supertest';
import { setupApi, database } from "./app.js";

// Top level test suite
describe('API', () => {
  let app;

  // Before any tests run, setup our Express app
  before(async () => {
    app = setupApi();
  });

  // Test the GET request
  test('GET request', async () => {
    // Supertest has built-in tests/assertions for response codes
    const { text } = await request(app).get('/').expect(200);
    assert.equal(text, "Get Received");
  });

  // A sub test suite so we can batch related tests
  describe('POST request', () => {
    // Test the POST request
    test("success", async () => {
      const { text } = await request(app).post("/").expect(200);
      assert.equal(text, "Post Received");
    });

    // We'll come back to this later. The Node Test Runner will print out that we have a test TODO later.
    test.todo('error');
  });
});
```

### Why Are We Importing from `node:test`?

If you try to just import `test` instead of `node:test` you'll get an error like this:
`Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'test' imported from .../app.test.js`.

The `node:` prefix tells Node that we are importing a core module. In this way, a
package from NPM won't be accidentally called if it has the same name as a core
module. `node:test` came after the `node:` prefix so node does not offer a non-prefixed
version.

### Why Are We Importing from `node:assert/strict`?

There is a strict version of `assert` and a non-strict. I've chosen the strict version
for the same reasons you would choose `===` over `==`. Just like `false === 0`
is false, `assert.equal(false, 0)` will throw an error because they aren't strictly
the same. For most use cases, `node:assert/strict` is probably what you want to use.

## Running the Tests

`node --test`

Yep! It is that simple. Node will automatically run any tests that
[match a specific criteria](/blog/nodejs-test-runner/#how-does-node-find-tests),
like those in a `test` directory or ending with `.test` (ex: `app.test.js`).

If you want to get fancy, run `node --test --watch` and Node will
[automatically rerun the tests](/blog/nodejs-test-runner/#watch-mode). Just use
`CTRL + C` to kill the process (or the Mac equivalent).

The Node test runner will execute all the tests and print out if they succeeded
or not. Then at the end, it will print a nice summary of all the tests.

## Testing Error Handling With Mocks

You may have noticed, our POST method has some error handling. How exactly can
we trigger the catch part of that try/catch statement? The Node Test Runner
has built-in mocking that we can use exactly for this. By mocking our `saveData`
function we can test that the error handling works as expected.

```javascript
// --- app.test.js ---

// ...
test('error', async (t) => {
  const mock = t.mock.method(database, 'saveData', () => {
    throw new Error('uh-oh!');
  });

  await request(app).post("/").expect(500);
  assert.equal(mock.mock.calls.length, 1);
});
// ...
```

## Conclusion

That is about it for basic tests on a Node Express app. If you want to see
the full source code used in this example, check out the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/bhdouglass/node-test-runner-express-example).

If you want to check out a slightly more complex test suit, take a look at the
tests for the [OpenStore API](https://gitlab.com/theopenstore/openstore-api).
I migrated that project from using Mocha to the Node Test Runner, which inspired
this post.
