In this blog post, I would like to share some of my favorite newsletters for software developers.
In today's ever-changing tech landscape where a new JavaScript framework is born every day,
staying up-to-date with the latest trends is crucial for any developer. Newsletters
can provide regular updates to keep you informed, while also not overwhelming you.
They contain links to articles that keep you informed about the latest developments,
and also can provide insights to help you improve your skills and advance your career.
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, these newsletters will help you stay
ahead of the curve and stay relevant in the ever-evolving tech industry.

centered around [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). But it also has articles about
[Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/). This is a fantastic weekly
read that provides quick summaries of articles for you to scan.

## Frontend Focus Newsletter

[Frontend Focus](https://frontendfoc.us/) is a newsletter that encompasses many
browser technologies, like HTML and CSS. Each edition of the newsletter includes
many different articles along with tutorials and resources. The resources section
is a great way to discover new tools and code that can be helpful.

The articles span a wide variety of different topics beyond just their CSS moniker.
The newsletter will send a few articles to your inbox every few weeks. Or you can
grab their RSS feed and stay up to date on all the latest articles.

that is more geared toward leads and managers. Many of the linked articles are
about culture and people.

in your podcast player of choice.

## HTMHell Newsletter

[HTMHell](https://www.htmhell.dev/newsletter/) is an amusingly named newsletter
about HTML and how or how not to use HTML. The "hell" part of the site has
real-life examples of how not to use HTML, while also pointing out the proper
usage of various elements. The "heaven" part of the site includes articles on
how to improve your HTML skills. In 2022 they published an amazing
[advent calendar](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/) which is worth a read
all on its own.

## Pointer Newsletter

[Pointer](https://www.pointer.io/) is a self-described "reading club for software
developers." This weekly email contains articles spanning a variety of topics.
The highlight of this newsletter is that it includes a "tl;dr;" section that sums
up the article. It is a great way to determine if an article is worth your time
to read fully.

## Bytes Newsletter

[Bytes](https://bytes.dev/) is a funny, tongue-in-cheek, weekly email about JavaScript.
They have a different approach with their newsletter where they focus on one
big _byte_ of JavaScript news. It also includes various smaller articles, all
with a humorous spin.

## ES.next Newsletter

[ES.next News](http://esnextnews.com/) is a short, weekly newsletter about JavaScript.
This newsletter is usually a quick read and won't take up much of your time. But
it also can help you keep up to date with the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Swizec's Newsletter

[Swizec](https://swizec.com/) is the author of a book called
["Senior Engineer Mindset"](https://swizec.com/senior-mindset/). And he also produces
a newsletter with a focus on software development careers. He also blogs about
other relevant coding topics.

## Go Make Things

[Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/) produces short, daily blog posts
with tips for developers. Many of the tips focus on vanilla JavaScript because
you don't always need a heavy-handed framework for everything.

## Tips for Reading Newsletters

How do you read a bunch of newsletters when there is code to write and deadlines
to fulfill? Skimming is your friend here. Skim over the articles and see if any
spark your imagination or might apply to you currently. Then, save the articles
somewhere to read later. There are plenty of services that provide this functionality,
like [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/),
or the [self-hosted](/blog/self-hosting/) [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/).
Come back later when you have dedicated time to read through the articles. Don't
feel like you need to read every word of every article, skim and skip around as
you need to. If something doesn't make sense you can always go back and read from
the top.

## Conclusion

Try out some of the above newsletters by subscribing. You never know when you might
find a useful tool or a great bit of career advice. It is always cheap and quick
to unsubscribe if you aren't getting anything out of them.
