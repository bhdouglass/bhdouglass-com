New to Vue and trying to get the "lay of the land"?

Tired of your current UI framework?

You can stop searching because you have found a list of 70+ Vue UI frameworks.
Each framework is listed with some stats to give you a sense of its relative
popularity. The list is ordered by GitHub stars, but also shows the NPM downloads
for the last thirty days. Don't worry, this page is updated with the latest stats
on a consistent basis. Listed with the stats is whether the library supports
Vue 3 and TypeScript. You can easily see at a glance if a framework will support
your modern workflow.

Found an issue with the list or want to add a new framework?
