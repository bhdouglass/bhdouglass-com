description: Several articles and tools for CSS.
---

I try to read a lot of development related articles and newsletters. I desire to
keep up with the latest trends to have a better understanding of the industry as
a whole. Here are a few articles and tools that I have discovered.

## [Creative list styling](https://web.dev/articles/creative-list-styling)

Michelle Barker writes an in-depth guide to the ubiquitous HTML list element.
The articles listed several features I wasn't aware of, like setting the starting
number for an ordered list. It also goes over various CSS options when using a list.
I highly recommend giving it a read if you ever work on HTML pages.

## [CSS container queries are finally here](https://ishadeed.com/article/container-queries-are-finally-here/)

If you follow anything CSS related, you have probably heard of CSS container queries.
They just recently dropped in Chrome and Safari. "Itâ€™s just how we used to write
CSS in media queries, but for a component level." This article explains how to
use container queries and why you would want to. Ahmad Shadeed also create a
[series of examples](https://lab.ishadeed.com/container-queries) using container
queries.

## [Flexbox Playground](https://flexbox.tech/)

Flexbox Playground is exactly what is says on the label. It is a playground to
understand how the different flexbox properties change the rendering of the
contained elements. CSS Tricks also has
[a guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/),
but Flexbox Playground lets you move things around in real time.

## [Not All Zeros are Equal](https://www.oddbird.net/2022/08/04/zero-units/)

I found this article to be an interesting read. It is not a scenario that I have
come across in my work, but never-the-less it is good to keep in mind if I ever
were to come across these issues. The bottom line from the article is, `0` is a
"number" and not a "length" and therefor you can not use a `0` and a "length" (ex: `5em`)
together in a `calc()` function.
