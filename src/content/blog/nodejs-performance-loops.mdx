JavaScript has several different ways to loop over array-like data. There are
standard for loops, for-of loops, the `.forEach()` method and, even `while` loops
if you want to get fancy.

But which loop is the best loop to use in your code?

## Table of contents

## The Different Ways to Loop

### Standard For Loop

```javascript
for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
  const value = array[index];`
}
```

The humble for loop is a staple among many different programming languages. You
define an index, then increment the index until you hit the end of the array.

### Standard For Loop (With Length Variable)

```javascript
for (let index = 0, length = array.length; index < length; index++) {
  const value = array[index];
}
```

This variant of the for loop is similar to the standard for loop with one key difference.
The length of the array is stored in a variable once, avoiding any potential
slowdowns when looking up the array's length.

### Reverse For Loop

```javascript
for (let index = array.length - 1; index >= 0; index--) {
  const value = array[index];
}
```

Similar to the above "standard for loop with length variable", this loop only
looks up the array's length once and then processes the array in reverse order.

### `Array.forEach()`

```javascript
array.forEach((value) => {});
```

Unlike the rest of the loop options, the `Array.forEach()` method is not a language
construct, but a function of the Array prototype. The other major difference is
that you are calling a function on each of the array elements.

### For-of

```javascript
for (const value of array) {}
```

The for-of loop is by far the most developer-friendly way of looping over an array.
It does lack the flexibility of some of the other options (for example a standard for
loop could only iterate over every other element), but it is the simplest to read.

### Reverse While

```javascript
let index = array.length;
while (index--) {
  const value = array[index];
}
```

The reverse while loop is similar to the reverse for loop. But it is simpler
to reason about.

### Forward While

```javascript
let index = -1;
while (++index < array.length) {
  const value = array[index];
}
```

The forward while is more complex to reason about than any of the other options.
I would recommend avoiding it if you can.

## Testing Methodology

In order to determine which looping method was the best I devised a set of benchmarks.
Using the [Tinybench](https://github.com/tinylibs/tinybench) library I tested
each loop method's effectiveness at calculating the sum of an array of numbers.
This way the JavaScript engine wouldn't see the loops as a no-op and optimize them
away.

I ran the tests at different array lengths to see a which point one method was better
than another. This way the results should show which loop is most effective for
a given data set.

The tests also use different run times to compare performance across engines.
Currently, the engines included are:

- Node.js v18
- Node.js v20
- Node.js v22
- Bun v1.1.18
- Deno v1.44.4

You can see the full test suite over at my [GitHub Repo](https://gitlab.com/bhdouglass/javascript-performance/-/blob/master/loops-tests.js).

Browsers weren't considered for this test as I'm mainly focusing on server-side
JavaScript engines.

## The Test Machine

Because context matters here, the machine I'm running these tests on is a
[System76 Darter Pro 8](/blog/system76-darter-pro-8). It has a 12th-generation
Intel CPU that clocks in around 4.70 GHz (model i7-1260P). And it has 32 GB of RAM.

## Results

Here are the results using arrays with lengths of ten, one thousand, and one million.

## Conclusions

Generally speaking, the standard for loop and the for loop with array length both
performed similarly. This leads me to believe that optimizations around the array length
lookups aren't necessary.

`Array.forEach()` performed the poorest across all array sizes. This is even more
apparent at large array sizes. This is because a function is being
invoked for each element, which leads to more processing than the other loop types.

The while loops didn't perform quite as well as the standard for loops.

The for-of loop performed worse compared to the standard for as the size of the array grew.

## So, what is the best loop for JavaScript?

The developer-friendly nature of the for-of loop makes it the best for small arrays.

However, when dealing with larger arrays and performance matters, switch to using
a standard for loop.

Avoid `Array.forEach()` as much as possible. The performance implications of calling
a function for each element causes this looping method to not be recommended.
