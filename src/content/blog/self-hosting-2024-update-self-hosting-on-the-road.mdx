My family recently started a [new adventure](https://ourlifeisavacation.com/),
a long-term road trip around America. If you are curious about the details, check
out my other [blog](https://ourlifeisavacation.com/blog/) or
[follow us on social media](https://ourlifeisavacation.com/follow/). But the
gist of the story is that we've sold our house and are now hopping around Airbnbs.

Since I'm into [self-hosting](/blog/self-hosting-with-docker-compose-migrating/)
(and even wrote [a guide about self-hosting OwnTrack](/blog/self-hosted-device-tracking-with-owntracks/)),
I've had to make adjustments since I no longer own a home to where I can stash my server.

## Why Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting, for me, is about sovereignty over my own data. I don't need to worry
about some big tech platform using my data to send me ads. Or a data breach exposing
my data to hackers (we get enough of those from other places, looking at you
Delta dental insurance ðŸ˜’).

Self-hosting is also a great way to learn. In my journey, I've picked up some
database management skills, reverse proxy skills, and, of course, Docker skills.

## My Previous Setup

In my previous setup, I had two servers running my services. One was a 1 GB virtual
server in [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.pxf.io/XY3BQg) and the other
was an old 32 GB laptop with various hard drives attached via USB. I should have
taken a picture of it before I put it into storage, but it was quite the sight with
4 external drives hanging off of it.

I split critical services off into the VPS with everything else being served
from the laptop in my basement.

## My New Setup

Now I no longer have the laptop in the mix and I've updated the 1 GB VPS to a 2
GB version to handle an increase in the services being run on it.

This simplifies things as there is only 1 server to deal with. However I can't
really host my JellyFin media server in the cloud, storage would get expensive!

So my work laptop now serves as a quasi-server for media-related services. When
we want to watch something on Jellyfin I have a docker-compose setup that I can
spin up after attaching an external drive.

## Services I'm Self-Hosting

Now that I'm more resource-contained in my self-hosting I've had to be more selective
about what I'm self-hosting and where.

### Services on My VPS

If you are curious about the details of my setup, check out this
[git repository](https://gitlab.com/bhdouglass/infra/-/tree/master/docker-compose/kepler).

#### [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/)

FreshRss is my RSS reader for keeping up on programming news and articles (among other things).
I also have a few YouTube channels in there. I find it it crazy that YouTube actually supports RSS!

#### [Gotify](https://gotify.net/)

Gotify is a self-hosted notification service. Paired with its Android app, I
have it set up to send me notifications from my StatPing-ng instance. You can
also easily send messages via any HTTP tool like curl.

#### [IT Tools](https://it-tools.tech/)

IT Tools is a collection of utilities for programmers. I mainly use the JSON-related
tools. I know there are other tools online, but I didn't like the idea of
putting my JSON data into random websites.

#### [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

Nextcloud is how I sync my personal calendar and contacts. It also serves as a
file sync for my laptop.

#### [Plausible](https://plausible.io/)

Plausible is an open-source website analytics tool. I even use it on this blog
rather than using Google Analytics.

#### [StatPing-ng](https://statping-ng.github.io/)

StatPing-ng is a network monitoring tool that I have set up to track various
websites and my self-hosting services. With its dashboard, I can easily tell
if anything is down when it shouldn't be.

#### [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)

Syncthing is a file synchronization tool that I mainly use to sync my notes
collection. I'm currently using [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) to manage them.

I have it set up on my phone, laptop, and VPS. That way my notes sync across all three
and my phone can sync when my laptop is offline and vice-versa. The Syncthing app
has an option to only sync once an hour, saving battery life.

#### [Tandoor](https://tandoor.dev/)

Tandoor is a recipe manager app. It also has a nice meal-planning feature. My wife
and I use this extensively to store our favorite recipes and organize our meal
plans for the coming week.

#### [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/)

Wallabag is a read-it-later service like Pocket or Instapaper. I don't use this
as much for reading as I should, but I do store stuff that I would like to read later...

### Services on My Laptop

I also have a few services on my laptop, those that are either more resource-intensive
or used less often.

#### [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)

Gitea is a GitHub-like service that I use mostly to back up my own Git repos
(kinda redundant since they are all on my laptop anyway...). But I also
use it to mirror the source code for some important open-source projects. Does anyone
remember the yt-dl incident?

#### [Calibre Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web)

Calibre Web is ab ebook manager that also has a really cool extra feature. You can
use it as a [sync backend for a Kobo e-reader](https://web.archive.org/web/20220311174306/https://www.brandonjkessler.com/2021/04/26/setup-kobo-sync-in-calibre-web/),
which is the only reason I actually own a Kobo.

#### [Monica](https://www.monicahq.com/)

Monica is a "personal relationship manager". Which is like a contact book on steroids.
I don't use it extensively, hence putting it on my laptop, but I would like to get
better in my relationships with other people.

#### [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)

And last, but not least, Jellyfin is a local media streaming app. I have to connect
an external hard drive with all our media files, but when we want to watch something
I can spin up the docker container and connect to it via an app on our Roku streaming
device.

## Conclusion

I do miss the ability to have a beefy server for running processes like media
encoding and paying with generative AI. Although I have whittled it down to the
most important services. At some point when we settle down again I would like
to build a proper server, with proper hard drive bays!
