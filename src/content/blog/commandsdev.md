description: A short post about a resource for command-line love.

As a short follow-up to [my recent post about Bash Oneliner](/blog/bash-oneliner/),
I was introduced to a command-line search engine called [Commands.dev](https://www.commands.dev/).
It looks like a fairly young service that allows you to search for various commands.
Right now the bulk of the commands are geared toward JavaScript development. However,
they allow contributions from the community. Just take a look at their
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/warpdotdev/workflows#contributing) for more
information. It seems like a promising service and I will be keeping my eye on it.
