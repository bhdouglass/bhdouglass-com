import DigitalOceanAffiliate from '../../components/support/DigitalOceanAffiliate.astro';

[OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org/) is a location-tracking app for both
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owntracks.android)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/owntracks/id692424691). OwnTracks
is an open-source alternative to the popular Life360 app. While the OwnTracks
app can be used on its own, setting up an OwnTracks server offers additional
benefits, such as the ability to share your location with others and having complete
control over your data. In this blog post, I will walk you through the process of setting
up your own, private, OwnTracks server. This fits in nicely with the Docker Compose that I have
[discussed previously](/blog/selfhosting-with-docker-compose-leaving-yunohost/).
While this guide assumes some knowledge of using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),
it will take you through the process step-by-step and help you get your
own OwnTracks server up and running quickly. So, let's get started!

## Table of contents

## Prerequisites

You must have a server running that you can easily access. I personally run
[Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).

You must have [Docker setup](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
as well as [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).
For easy access to the `docker compose` command, add this alias to your `~/.bashrc`
file: `alias dc='docker compose'`. Then you can type `dc` rather than `docker compose`.

## Setting Up the OwnTracks Server

Setup a `docker-compose.yml` file on your server:

```yaml
version: "3.6"
services:
  owntracks-recorder:
    container_name: owntracks-recorder
    image: owntracks/recorder
    ports:
      - 8083:8083
    environment:
      - OTR_PORT=0 # disables MQTT
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - ./owntracks-recorder/config:/config
      - ./owntracks-recorder/store:/store
    restart: unless-stopped
```

For simplicity, I have disabled MQTT support and instead run everything over HTTP.

Start the OwnTracks Recorder server with the command `docker compose up`. The
server will be listening on your server's IP address at port 8083. You can
view the basic interface by going to `http://<server-ip>:8083` in your browser.

## Make OwnTracks Accessible from the Internet

Now that you have a working OwnTracks Recorder you can access it from your local
network. But that does not do you any good if you want to track your journeys
outside your LAN. In order to be able to update your location on the go, you need
to put the Recorder behind a reverse proxy.

There are several options for doing this, like [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)
and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). My current setup uses [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/)
so I'll detail that below. No matter what reverse proxy you decide to use, you
**must protect your OwnTracks Recorder with authentication**. By itself, the
Recorder does not provide any authentication.

Add the following to your `docker-compose.yml` as part of the `owntracks-recorder`
service:

```yaml
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.owntracks.rule=Host(`owntracks.your-domain.com`) # Set this to your prefered domain
      - traefik.http.routers.owntracks.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.owntracks.tls.certresolver=cloudflare # Only needed if you use Cloudflare for certificates
      - traefik.http.services.owntracks.loadbalancer.server.port=8083
      - traefik.http.routers.owntracks.middlewares=owntracks-auth # Enable basic auth
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.owntracks-auth.basicauth.users=test:$$apr1$$H6uskkkW$$IgXLP6ewTrSuBkTrqE8wj/,test2:$$apr1$$d9hr9HBB$$4HxwgUir3HP4EsggP/QNo0"
```

You will need to setup your users as part of the last line by using the `htpasswd` command.
The [Traefik docs](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/basicauth/)
recommends running it like:

```bash
echo $(htpasswd -nB YOUR_USER_NAME) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g`.
```

This makes sure it is in the proper format. You can add as many users as you like to the
label, just separate them each with a comma.

This setup assumes you already have a Traefik container running as part of your
`docker-compose.yml` file. To get started with Traefik, check out their
[getting started guide](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/quick-start/).

## Setting Up the App

### Android

Once you [download the Android app from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owntracks.android)
you can easily get set up with your new OwnTracks server. Head into the menu and
enter the "Preferences" screen.

Tap to edit "Connection" and select HTTP as the "Mode." For the "Host" section you can put in `https://<your domain>/pub`.

For the "Identification" the username and password need to match the basic auth
credentials that you set on your reverse proxy. The "Device ID" should be something
unique to the device (no spaces allowed). Be sure to remember it later if you want to
set up friends. The "Tracker ID" is a two-character identifier that will show up
on the map for you and your friends.

<img src="/images/blog/owntracks/owntracks-android-app-configuration.png" alt="Side-by-side screenshots of the OwnTracks Android app. On the left is the Host configuration and on the right is the Identification configuration." />

### iOS

Once you [download the iOS app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/owntracks/id692424691)
you can easily get set up with your new OwnTracks server. Head into the menu and
enter the "Settings" screen.

Choose HTTP as the "Mode" and enter the two-character identifier for the "Tracker ID."
The "Tracker ID" will show up on the map for you and any friends.

Add the "Device ID" as something unique to the device (no spaces allowed). You will
need this later when setting up friends. Then enter the "User ID" and "Password"
to match the basic auth credentials that you set on your reverse proxy.

Finally, set the "URL" as `https://<your domain>/pub`.

### Verify it Works

Now your device should be all set to communicate with your OwnTracks Recorder server.
To verify that it is receiving data from your device, navigate to the web UI and
enter your basic auth credentials. If you are not prompted for your basic auth
credentials, revisit your reverse proxy settings.

You should see any devices registered both in the list and on the provided map.

## Allow Friends Access

Want to share your location data with a loved one or friends and stop using apps
like Life360? The setup process is a bit esoteric, but once set you shouldn't
need to fuss with it. Create a file in `./owntracks-recorder/config` (relative
to the `docker-compose.yml`) called `friends.txt`. Since this is part of the
container's volumes we can edit it from the host and load it into the database
from inside the container.

The file should be formatted like this:

```plain
<username>-<device> ["<username>/<device>", "<friend-username>/<fiend-device>"]
<friend-username>-<friend-device> ["<username>/<device>", "<friend-username>/<fiend-device>"]
```

The format of the first part of each line is important and tripped me up when
first setting up my own OwnTracks Recorder.

Enter the Docker container using:

```bash
docker compose exec owntracks-recorder sh
```

Once at a shell in the container, run:

```bash
ocat --load=friends < /config/friends.txt
```

This loads the friends file into the database. Verify the friends were loaded by running:

```bash
ocat --dump=friends
```

Now you and your friends/family can view each other's locations from within the app.

## Pretty Images on the Map

Right now the map should only show the "Tracker ID" for each device being tracked.
To make this look nicer, you need to [set up a card](https://owntracks.org/booklet/features/card/)
for each user.

### GitHub Avatar

To use the avatar from a GitHub user, download [github2card.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owntracks/recorder/master/contrib/faces/github2card.py).
Set the script as executable (`chmod +x github2card.py`), then run:

```bash
github2card.py GITHUB_USERNAME > card.json
```

### Gravatar

To use the avatar from Gravatar, download [gravatar2card.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owntracks/recorder/master/contrib/faces/gravatar2card.sh).
Set the script as executable (`chmod +x gravatar2card.sh`), then run:

```bash
gravatar2card.sh GRAVATAR_EMAIL "FULL NAME" > card.json
```

### Local Image

To use a local image, download [image2card.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owntracks/recorder/master/contrib/faces/image2card.sh).
Make sure you have the `convert` command installed from ImageMagic.
Set the script as executable (`chmod +x image2card.sh`), then run:

```bash
image2card.sh /path/to/file.jpg "FULL NAME" > card.json
```

### Put the Cards on the Server

Once you have created a `card.json` file, you can put them on your server to
be served by OwnTracks Recorder. Store the files for each user in
`./owntracks-recorder/store/cards/<username>/<username>.json`.

Now you can have nice images on your maps!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, setting up an OwnTracks server using Docker is a great way to get
the most out of this GPS tracking app. With your own server, you can easily share
your data with others and access it from multiple devices, all while maintaining
control over your data. No longer do you need to entrust your location data to
a third party. This step-by-step guide has covered everything you need to know to
set up your own OwnTracks server, from creating the Docker Compose configuration
to sharing it with your friends and family. I hope you found this tutorial useful
and that you're now ready to start using your own OwnTracks server!
