In my [last post](/blog/how-to-publish-an-ubuntu-touch-app/), I wrote about
how to manually publish an app to the OpenStore. Now that you have your Ubuntu
Touch app generally available it would be great to be able to automatically publish
updates to your app. I wrote a post a few years ago about
[publishing apps to the OpenStore automatically with GitLab's CI](/blog/publishing-apps-to-the-openstore-with-gitlab-ci/).
I just updated this post with up-to-date information on Clickable v7 and GitLab's CI
syntax. There is also the corresponding [example app](https://gitlab.com/clickable/clickable-gitlab-ci-test)
that can be used as a reference.
