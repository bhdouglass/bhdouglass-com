description: Seamlessly upgrade Tailwind CSS for an Astro site
---

With [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4) recently released
I set aside some time to upgrade my Astro sites to take advantage of the new release.
However, the upgrade isn't fully automated. So here my guide to upgrading Astro
sites to use Tailwind CSS v4.

## Upgrade Astro

First, you'll need to make sure Astro is up to date. [Astro v5.2](https://astro.build/blog/astro-520/#tailwind-4-support)
released with support for Tailwind CSS, so you need to be at least on that version
to have full Tailwind v4 support.

If you aren't on Astro 5.x already, be sure to follow the [migration guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/)
to get from 4.x to 5.x. The 5.x upgrade was fairly smooth for most of my sites.

To upgrade your site, run `npx @astrojs/upgrade` from the base of the project.

After upgrading, double check that you site still passes the Astro checks and builds correctly.

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
```

Also, launch your site locally and double check its functionality.

## Upgrade Tailwind

You can upgrade Tailwind on your site by using the excellent migration tool:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

Before you run the tool you'll probably want to commit your previous Astro upgrade.
Otherwise the Tailwind migration tool will complain about the git repository not
being clean. To bypass this complaint, use the `--force` parameter.

If the tool fails to migration your site, check the [Tailwind upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide)
for how to manually upgrae.

The migration tool failed to migrate the default postcss config (`postcss.config.cjs`).
But you can delete that as we will configure Astro to use the Tailwind Vite plugin.

## Remove the Old Astro Tailwind Integration

Now that Astro and Tailwind have both been updated we can get them talking to gether again.
But first you will need to remove the old Astro Tailwind integration. Run:

```bash
npm remove @astrojs/tailwind
```

And then delete all references to `@astrojs/tailwind` from your `astro.config.mjs` file.

## Install the New Astro Tailwind Integration

Out with the old and in with the new. You'll need to run `npx astro add tailwind`
to get the new Tailwind integration for Astro (which is really just a Vite plugin).

![Astro tool adding Tailwind](/images/blog/astro/astro-add-tailwind.webp)

The Astro tool will add the Vite plugin to your configuration and install the correct
dependencies. Since you already Tailwind setup you can skip the step that generates
a `global.css` file.

## Finishing Up

Since the old Tailwind integration is gone and the new one setup, the last thing
to do is recheck everything. You can run `npm run check && npm run build`, but
you'll really need to do a visual inspection of your site. Everything should
"just work", but better safe than sorry!

## Checklist

TLDR; here are the steps needed to take to upgrade your Astro site to Tailwind v4.

- <input type="checkbox" /> Upgrade Astro to v5.2 or later: `npx @astrojs/upgrade`
- <input type="checkbox" /> Check that the upgrade went smoothly: `npm run check && npm run build`
- <input type="checkbox" /> Upgrade Tailwind to v4: `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade`
- <input type="checkbox" /> Remove the old PostCSS config, `postcss.config.cjs` (if you have one)
- <input type="checkbox" /> Remove the old Tailwind integration: `npm remove @astrojs/tailwind`
- <input type="checkbox" /> Clean the old Tailwind integration from `astro.config.mjs`
- <input type="checkbox" /> Install the new Tailwind integration: `npx astro add tailwind`
- <input type="checkbox" /> Check that the upgrade went smoothly (again): `npm run check && npm run build`
- <input type="checkbox" /> Visually check the site: `npm run dev`
