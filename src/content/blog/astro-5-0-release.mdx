description: Already time to upgrade again!

It feels like yesterday Astro was just releasing [version 4.0](/blog/astro-4-0-release/).
But just in time for the Christmas holiday, [Astro 5.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/).
Did they plan that so everyone would upgrade their sites over the break? Let's be real,
die-hard fans already upgraded yesterday!

## Table of contents

## Content Layer

The two headline features in this release are the upgraded [Content Layer](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
and the new [Server Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-islands/).

The Content Layer expands their content collections from files on disk to APIs,
databases, and more. You can define a simple loader for an HTTP request or dive
deeper and include caching and pagination. And of course, files on disk are still
supported with a built-in `glob` loader.

There are already a bunch of [community-built loaders](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=loaders)
to choose from. Or you can get started on your own [custom loader](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#building-a-custom-loader).

## Server Islands

The other headline feature, [Server Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-islands/),
is an expansion of Astro islands architecture.

Previously restricted to islands on the frontend, Server Islands brings islands
to the backend. This allows you to cache the static parts of pages while also
including server-rendered dynamic content like a shopping cart or user profile.

Check out the full [Server Islands guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-islands/)
for more information.

## Other Changes & Features

Astro 5 brings some other notable changes. `astro:env` has moved out of experimental
and hopes to improve environment variable handling within Astro, both on the server
and client (no more exposing your API keys on the client!).

Astro 5 also redefines static rendering by removing the `hybrid` rendering mode.
But you may ask, how does removing hybrid rendering improve static rendering? Well
hybrid rendering was a bridge between server and static rendering where parts of
your side could opt-in or opt-out of static rendering.

Now that behavior has moved into the default `static` renderer. By default, pages
will be statically rendered. Dynamic pages can opt out of static rendering by
using the following code: `export const prerender = false;`.

## New Experiments

It wouldn't be an Astro release without some hints as to where the next release
of Astro is going. The new experiments as responsive images and SVG loading.

Astro already has image handling with their built-in `Image` component. However, the
experiment expands that to also generate different image sizes for responsive images.
This includes settings `srcset` and `sizes` properly.

SVG components are a very welcome addition for me personally. I recently started a
new project that needed to be able to have SVG icons. The old advice was to use
`<Fragment set:html={icon} />` which wasn't the greatest if you wanted to customize
the icon. In that project, I ended up using [react-svgr](https://react-svgr.com/)
which was great.

But with Astro 5 you can import SVGs just like any other component.
For example, `import Icon from '../assets/icon.svg';`

## Upgrading to Astro 5

<RandomSupport />

The [Astro 5 upgrade guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/)
seems rather intimidating, but for most people, you shouldn't have too many issues.

If you are using a content collection, you'll want to read over the [upgrade guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/#what-should-i-do-2)
to use the new Content Layer. Mostly this involves pointing the built-in `glob` loader
to your local files and changing from using the `slug` property to the `id` property.

If you are using Typescript support with Astro, you'll need to be aware of the changes
around `env.d.ts`. The `env.d.ts` file can be removed and your `tsconfig.json` file
can be updated with `.astro/types.d.ts` in the includes. See the [upgrade guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v5/#changed-typescript-configuration)
for the details.

When upgrading [this site](https://gitlab.com/bhdouglass/bhdouglass-com) I ran
into some dependency issues. At the time of writing, there seems to be a peer dependency
issue between `@astrojs/mdx` and `astro`. There was a similar issue between `astro-pagefind`
and `astro`. Both weren't a big deal and I was able to install them with `npm install --force`.
This may not be a long-term solution, but since Astro 5 was only released a few days ago
these issues will likely be ironed out soon.
