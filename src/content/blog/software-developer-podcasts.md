## Table of contents

## Developer Tea

[Developer Tea](https://developertea.com) is a thought-provoking podcast for
software developers. It's not solely about coding but delves into management,
values, feedback, and much much more. Developer Tea is a short-form podcast which
is perfect because it's not one that you want to be multitasking with! Be sure
to keep your notes app open while listening.

## Changelog

[The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) isn't just one developer podcast,
it's a whole network of podcasts for developers. There is a diverse number of
topics covered on each of the podcasts. There are several language-specific podcasts
like [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty) and [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime).
The network also offers other options like [Ship It!](https://changelog.com/shipit), a
podcast about pushing out ideas, and [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast) itself
with short, humor-infused news segments and long-form technology discussions.

## JS Party

[JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty) is a podcast in the Changelog network
mentioned above but deserves its own separate section. As you might have guessed
from the name, this is a mostly JavaScript-focused podcast. Not only JavaScript,
this podcast also covers frontend technology and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
with an occasional look at alternatives like [Deno](https://deno.land/).

## Coder Radio

[Coder Radio](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/coder-radio/) is a weekly talk show by
[Jupiter Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/). The hosts cover a
wide array of topics from tech news to small businesses. This is a great podcast
for keeping up with tech trends and isn't overly technical.

[Jupiter Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) also hosts many
technology-related podcasts like [Linux Unplugged](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linux-unplugged/)
and [Self-Hosted](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/self-hosted/).

## How to support podcasters

Podcasters spend a lot of time and effort producing high-quality podcasts, not only
for developers but for every niche possible. How can you support their efforts
and let them know that their time was well spent?

The simplest way to support a podcast is to leave a review on whatever platforms
you can. This is a great way to give feedback to the podcasters while also boosting
their rankings.

While not as tangible as a review, word of mouth can also be an effective way to
support podcasts. Tell all your friends and social media followers to help the
podcast gain even more listeners.

Many podcasts can also be financially contributed to via memberships or one-off
payments like boosts. [Boosts](https://fountain.fm/faqs/value-for-value) are a
form of direct feedback and direct financial contribution via [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/).
