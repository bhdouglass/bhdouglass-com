With the introduction of [Node.js v22](../node-22/), Node.js now has a built-in
task runner. This is a handy alternative to `npm run` and `yarn run` that is
focused on speed.

Update: The task runner is now stable as of [Node.js v22.10.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.10.0#node---run-is-now-stable).

## How to use the Task Runner

<NewsletterForm />

To get started using the Node.js task runner, use
[`node --run`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cli.html#--run) with the latest
version of Node.js. `node --run` allows you to quickly run one of your "scripts"
from your `package.json` file. For example, `node --run generate` will run the
"generate" script.

## Limitations of the Node.js Task Runner

The Node.js task runner aims to be built-in and more performant than the package
manager alternatives. By doing so, it has been intentionally limited to only the
`package.json` file in the current directory.

It will not look for any other `package.json` file to run the script.
It will append the current `node_modules/.bin` to the PATH when running the script,
but it won't search for the node_modules, it will just use the one in the current directory.
The task runner will also ignore any `pre` or `post` scripts and stick to only
running the requested script.

## `node --run` vs `npm run`

Barring the intentional limitations listed above, `node --run` and `npm run`
work very similarly. However, in my testing, `node --run` outperforms `npm run`
by about 100ms. That might not seem like much, but considering how many times
a day one developer runs scripts from their `package.json` multiplied by the
size of their team, it can add up to hours in development time saved over a
year.
