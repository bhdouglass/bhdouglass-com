description: A quick post about a resource for app patterns in web apps.
---

The blog, [web.dev](https://web.dev/) is a great resource for developers by
the Chrome team. In one of their recent posts,
[New patterns for amazing apps](https://web.dev/blog/new-patterns-for-amazing-apps?hl=en),
Thomas Steiner details some of the resources present on web.dev. There a lots of
code snippets for how to do various app patterns, like handling clipboards.
Each pattern comes with a bunch of these fully functional snippets. This is definitely
an article that I will be saving for future reference.
