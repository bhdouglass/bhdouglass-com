Update: Version 3.0 is old news, check out [Astro 4.0](../astro-4-0-release/)!

The [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework has been constantly churning out great updates.
The project released [version 1.0](../astro-1-0-release/) only about a year before
the current [3.0 release](https://astro.build/blog/astro-3/). This release
contains several new features and some breaking changes to be aware of. Let's
dive into the latest release notes!

## New Features

Image optimization is now stable and available without any hoops to jump through.
Check out the [Astro image guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/)
for how to use the `<Image>` element. If you were previously using `@astrojs/image`
then you'll want to check out the [image migration guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#upgrade-to-v30-from-v2x). I've been using the `@astrojs/image` components on
various sites and have been very pleased with the results. It is great to see this
get first-class support in Astro.

According to their benchmarks, Astro now renders 30-75% faster than version 2.9.
This is on top of the gains they have already gotten from parallelizing their
component rendering in [Astro 2.5](../astro-2-5-release/).

Astro 3.0's headline feature is the view transitions support. This can turn multi-page
apps (MPAs) into slick apps that you might think was a single-page app (SPA). You can
transition between pages with fade, slide, and morph animations. Check out the full
[view transitions guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) to
get started with your own site. Or see it in action with this [live demo](https://astro-records.pages.dev/) created by [Maxi Ferreira](https://twitter.com/charca).

Additionally, Astro 3.0 has enhanced its Serverless support, enabled "Fast Refresh"
support when working with React and Preact, and has optimized its build output
with cleaner HTML.

## Breaking Changes

Astro 3.0 drops support for Node.js 16 (which hit end of life recently) and TypeScript
4. So make sure you upgrade your versions accordingly.

As mentioned above, `@astrojs/image` has been removed in favor of integrated image support.

The `getStaticPaths()` function's return value is no longer flattened. I ran into this
while upgrading [this site](../built-with-astro/), but it was a simple fix from using
`map()` to using `flatMap()`.

The default port that the dev server uses has been changed from `3000` to `4321`.

Compressing built HTML is now the default, so if you were using the `compressHTML: true`
setting, you can remove it.

These are just some of the bigger breaking changes that I noticed. Take a look a
the full [v3 migration guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v3/)
for further help upgrading.
