In this blog post, I would like to share some of my favorite newsletters for software developers.
In today's ever-changing tech landscape where a new JavaScript framework is born every day,
staying up-to-date with the latest trends is crucial for any developer. Newsletters
can provide regular updates to keep you informed, while also not overwhelming you.
They contain links to articles that keep you informed about the latest developments,
and also can provide insights to help you improve your skills and advance your career.
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, these newsletters will help you stay
ahead of the curve and stay relevant in the ever-evolving tech industry.

## Unicorn Club

Despite the silly name, the [Unicorn Club](https://unicornclub.dev/) is a newsletter
with resources that focus on UX and UI design. It also has a lot of front-end
development focus.

## Tips for Reading Newsletters

How do you read a bunch of newsletters when there is code to write and deadlines
to fulfill? Skimming is your friend here. Skim over the articles and see if any
spark your imagination or might apply to you currently. Then, save the articles
somewhere to read later. There are plenty of services that provide this functionality,
like [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/),
or the [self-hosted](/blog/self-hosting/) [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/).
Come back later when you have dedicated time to read through the articles. Don't
feel like you need to read every word of every article, skim and skip around as
you need to. If something doesn't make sense you can always go back and read from
the top.

## Conclusion

Try out some of the above newsletters by subscribing. You never know when you might
find a useful tool or a great bit of career advice. It is always cheap and quick
to unsubscribe if you aren't getting anything out of them.
