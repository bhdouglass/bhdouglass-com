The release of [Node.js 20](../node-20/) includes a new [Permission Model](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html#permission-model).
Why is this important? It allows developers to restrict Node.js scripts from
accessing the filesystem, child processes, and worker threads.

## Table of Contents

## Getting Started

To use the new Permission model you will need to [download version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or your favorite Node.js version manager.
(Check out [Volta](https://volta.sh/)!)

Enable the experimental Permission Model by passing the
[`--experimental-permission`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--experimental-permission)
flag to the node command. For example: `node --experimental-permission some-script.js`.

## Permissions

By itself, `--experimental-permission` will lock down the process and prevent access
to the filesystem, child processes, and worker threads. Use this flag in conjunction
with the following flags to granularly enable permissions on a per-process basis.

### [`--allow-fs-read`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--allow-fs-read)

This flag allows access to read from the filesystem (not write). To allow
full read access, use: `--allow-fs-read=*`. Or pass a comma-separated list
of paths to limit access: `--allow-fs-read=/some/path,/some/other/file.json`.

### [`--allow-fs-write`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--allow-fs-write)

This flag allows access to write to the filesystem (not read). To allow
full write access, use: `--allow-fs-write=*`. Or pass a comma-separated list
of paths to limit access: `--allow-fs-write=/some/path,/some/other/file.json`.

### [`--allow-child-process`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--allow-child-process)

This flag allows access to running child processes. Currently, there is no way to
restrict while child processes can be spawned. This means that a script could use
a child process to gain write access to the system without specifically allowing
it via `--allow-fs-write`.

### [`--allow-worker`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--allow-worker)

This flag allows worker threads to be spawned. The worker thread will retain the
same permissions as the process that spawned it.

### [`--allow-addons`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cli.html#--allow-addons)

This flag allows [native addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) to be used.
This is available in [Node.js version 21.6.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.6.0#changes-to-the-permission-model).

## [`--allow-wasi`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cli.html#--allow-wasi)

This flag allows WASI instances using the [web assembly system interface module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/wasi.html).
This is avaiable in [Node.js version 22.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.3.0)

## Checking for Filesystem Permissions

Now that you can restrict permissions to a given script. How does the script see
if it has the necessary permissions to proceed?

To check permissions, a script can use [`process.permission.has()`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processpermissionhasscope-reference).
This new function returns true or false if the given process has permission to the
provided `scope`. The scope can be either `fs`, `fs.read`, or `fs.write` for filesystem access,
read access, and write access respectively.

The second, optional, argument to `process.permission.has()` is a path to test
for access. For example, to check for write access to a certain path, use:
`process.permission.has('fs.write', '/some/path')`.

## Checking Permissions for Child Processes and Worker Threads

The `process.permission.has()` function will only tell you if the script has
file system access. The only way to check for child process and worker thread access
is to handle the `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` error that gets thrown if permission is denied.

## Conclusion

It is important to note that the permission model is experimental in Node.js version
20. And also, at this time Node.js 20 is not the supported LTS. So the Permission
Model may be subject to change in the future. That being said, it is exciting to
see where Node.js will be in the coming releases!
